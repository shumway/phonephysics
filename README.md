# Phone Physics

Course materials based on “A Century of Physics on a Smart Phone,”
an interdisciplinary seminar I taught for the Barret Honors 
College at Arizona State University in Spring 2013.
I left academics to pursue a career in software development immediately after that
semester, and I would like to make these materials available for use by others.
I am licensing these with a [CC0 public domain license](CC0) to give teachers as much freedom
as possible to incorperate these materials in their classes.

## Background

Smart phones and related computer and network technology are essentially magic.
This technology has transformed our lives, yet few people understand how it all words.
Understanding is critical to be able to undestand our place in history and plan for
the future.
With some basic insights of where we are and how we got here, we can better plan our
careers and envision the world we give to our children.

The inital idea for this class came from [Prof. Ian Galbraith](Galbraith), when he and I were
hiking on the Isle of Skye.
As we sat down for a snack break and some water, Ian picked up his camera
and said “you could teach much of an undergraduate physics program just explaining this device.”
Optics, semiconductor physics, battery technology, electronics, and materials science
all underlie the operation of a small digital camera.

A couple years later the Barret Honors College at Arizona State University had
a call for new course ideas.
I had thought about Ian's insight, and how it applied even stronger to smart phones,
which added general computing, touchscreens, and wireless networking to digital cameras features.
I was also intrigued by the the interplay of ideas between two excellent books I had read:
_[Dealers of Lightning: Xerox PARC and the Dawn of the Computer Age](Lightning)_
by Michael Hiltzik and _[Steve Jobs](Jobs)_ by Walter Isaacson.
To me, the human story behind innovation and the complex reasons for commercial
success or failure is just as facinating as the magic of science and technology.

My course proposal was accepted, and I taught the seminar to 20 honors students
in spring 2013.
Concidentally, I jumped at a great job opportuntiy in a startup company that
same semester, so the course was not realized to its full potential.
Even in its basic form, it was a very enjoyable teaching expereince and a great
way to wrap up my academic career.

## Current State

I am starting the public repo in 2016 to share my work with anyone who is interested
in using it.
Currently the material is on a wordpress blog, http://phonephysics.wordpress.com,
and I am migrating the data over to GitHub to make it easier for people to reuse or 
contribute to it.
